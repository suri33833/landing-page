        <p class="text-sm">
          This year the World Economic Forum identified cybercrime as
          potentially posing a more significant risk to society than terrorism.
          As machines take over more of our lives, hacking and cybercrime
          inevitably become more of a problem, as every connected device you add
          to a network is inevitably a potential point-of-failure that an
          attacker could use against you. As networks of connected devices
          become more complex, identifying those points of failure becomes more
          complex. This is where AI can play a role, though. By analyzing
          network traffic and learning to recognize patterns that suggest
          nefarious intentions, smart algorithms are increasingly playing a role
          in keeping us safe from 21st-century crime. Some of the most
          significant applications of AI that we will see develop in 2022 are
          likely to be in this area.

        <p class="text-sm">
          We know that AI can be used to create art, music, poetry, plays, and
          even video games. In 2022, as new models such as GPT-4 and Google’s
          Brain redefine the boundaries of what’s possible, we can expect more
          elaborate and seemingly “natural” creative output from our
          increasingly imaginative and capable electronic friends. Rather than
          these creations generally being demonstrations or experiments to show
          off the potential of AI, as is the case now, in 2022, we will
          increasingly see them applied to routine creative tasks, such as
          writing headlines for articles and newsletters, designing logos and
          infographics. Creativity is often seen as a very human skill, and the
          fact we are now seeing these capabilities emerging in machines means
          “artificial” intelligence is undeniably coming closer in terms of
          scope and function to the somewhat nebulous concept we have of what
          constitutes “real” intelligence.

          There have always been fears that machines or robots will replace
          human workers and maybe even make some roles redundant. However, as
          companies navigate the process of creating data and AI-literate
          cultures within their teams, we will increasingly find ourselves
          working with or alongside machines that use smart and cognitive
          functionality to boost our own abilities and skills. In some
          functions, such as marketing, we’re already used to using tools that
          help us determine which leads are worth pursuing and what value we can
          expect from potential customers. In engineering roles, AI tools help
          us by providing predictive maintenance – letting us know ahead of time
          when machines will need servicing or repairing. In knowledge
          industries, such as law, we will increasingly use tools that help us
          sort through the ever-growing amount of data that's available to find
          the nuggets of information that we need for a particular task. In just
          about every occupation, smart tools and services are emerging that can
          help us do our jobs more efficiently, and in 2022 more of us will find
          that they are a part of our everyday working lives.
